1. User registration & Login system 
The Online Flight Booking System can be accessed using user registration & login. By providing personal information like name, email address, and password, this will then be kept secure in the system. During the register, users will have to use credentials and checks to ensure no unwanted access happens. This will be verified by the system, and secure the user's account access. This feature permits tracking of user activities and guarantees data security.

2. Search available flights 
Users then proceed with searching available flights by using keywords such as their travel destination and date to book. The system then displays matching flights including the necessary information, such as flight schedule, cost and seat availability. Other than that, for fully booked flights, flight availability, and seat availability will be shown with appropriate messages such as “Full Flight”, "No flights available for these criteria." and “Available”. This feature ensures users easy browsing during their search for the suitable flights to travel with.

3. Select flight & Seat 
As available flights are found, users will be prompted to select a specific flight from the results. Upon selection, the system retrieves the current seat map from the database and displays the layout. The user can view which seats are "Available" or "Occupied". When a user clicks a seat, the system verifies its status in real-time. If available, the seat is locked to prevent double-booking; if not, an error is shown.

4. Payment processing 
The system will be able to enable the user to pay the flight booking they chose. Once the user has made the choice of the flight, the system will show a payment page where the user will be expected to key in details like the card number or wherever the user has bank accounts online. The system verifies the payment information entered and forwards payment request to payment gateway. In case of a successful payment, the system makes a confirmation of the booking and the user is provided with a message of the payment success. In case of failure of payment or invalidity of payment details, then the system gives a suitable message of error and provides the user with an option of re-making the payment.

5. Booking confirmation
The system shall generate a booking confirmation after the payment for a flight is successfully completed. Once the payment is confirmed, the system records the booking details and generates a confirmation message containing information such as booking ID, flight details, passenger details, and payment status. The system then displays the booking confirmation to the user and provides an electronic ticket (e-ticket) or confirmation receipt for future reference.
